# Installation

There are two components required for G-CLI:

* The G-CLI proxy application which is launched from the command line.
* The G-CLI library which must be installed to each LabVIEW version.

## G-CLI Library

The G-CLI library is available through VIPM.

1. Launch VIPM.
2. Search for `G-CLI`
3. Install for each version of LabVIEW you need.

## G-CLI Proxy

On Windows this is installed by VIPM at the same time as the library.

On Linux you need to download a package from Github. Link tbc.
